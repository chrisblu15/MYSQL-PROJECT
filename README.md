### 🔹 2. Top and Bottom Performing Regions by Sales
- **Top 3 Regions**: These regions recorded the **highest total sales** over the four years.
- **Bottom 3 Regions**: These contributed the least to revenue.

### 🔹 5. Shipping Method with the Highest Total Cost
- Shipping costs were aggregated by shipping mode.
- **Insight**: **Express Air** emerged as the most expensive shipping method. While it may offer faster delivery, its cost-effectiveness should be reassessed, especially for low-priority orders.
