### üîπ 1. Most Frequently Sold Product Category
- The category with the **highest number of purchases** was identified using a count of product categories.
- **Insight**: The dominant product category (e.g., **Office Supplies**) had the highest order frequency, indicating steady customer demand and market share in this segment.

### üîπ 2. Top and Bottom Performing Regions by Sales
- **Top 3 Regions**: These regions recorded the **highest total sales** over the four years.
- **Bottom 3 Regions**: These contributed the least to revenue.
- **Insight**: Sales were heavily concentrated in a few key regions (e.g., Nunavut, Ontario), suggesting potential for geographic sales expansion or localized marketing in underperforming regions.

### üîπ 3. Sales of Appliances in Ontario

### üîπ 5. Shipping Method with the Highest Total Cost
- Shipping costs were aggregated by shipping mode.
- **Insight**: **Express Air** emerged as the most expensive shipping method. While it may offer faster delivery, its cost-effectiveness should be reassessed, especially for low-priority orders.

### üîπ 6. Most Valuable Customers & What They Buy
- Customers with the **highest total sales** were extracted along with the products they typically purchase.
- **Insight**: These high-value clients are important to retain. They often buy high-margin or frequently sold items, suggesting opportunities for bundling or loyalty incentives.

### üîπ 7. Top Small Business Customer

- **Insight**: Regular ordering indicates a stable B2B relationship. Consider special discounts or account-based marketing to maintain this loyalty.

### üîπ 9. Most Profitable Consumer

### üîπ 11. Are Shipping Costs Aligned with Order Priority?
- Shipping cost and mode were analyzed in relation to **Order Priority**.
- **Insight**: Some **low-priority orders were shipped using costly methods like Express Air**, which is inefficient. High-priority orders sometimes used slower shipping.
- **Recommendation**: Enforce shipping policies that align delivery method with priority:
  - **Express Air** for "Critical"/"High"
